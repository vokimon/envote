The purpose of this program is to simulate the Spanish electoral system
in order to get objective insight on how it works despite the myhts 
that exist about what is better to do.

Some common myths and questions which are quite common within the 
spanish society are:
- When I vote to a minoritary party, is it a loose of force to avoid
some evil party majority? Should i vote to a less evil majoritary party?
- Who gets benefited or damaged when anyone does not vote, votes blank, 
null, or does a protest vote to a system protesting party?
- Is the electoral threshold actual damaging minoritary options?
Is that possible in a given election?

Using this program you can simulate vote flows from one option to
another, being the options not just parties but also abstention, 
blank and null votes.

You can also review historical results and use that data to establish
a worse case scenario for each so you can keep the faithful voters
when simulating vote flows.


This program was started by the 15M movement activists in Sant 
Joan Desp√≠ (Barcelona, Spain) to provide objective arguments about
what is worth to do or not on the 2011 Spanish Parlament polls,
with the hope that although our electoral and political 
system is quite unfair, we could find holes that we can use to
empower our democracy.
